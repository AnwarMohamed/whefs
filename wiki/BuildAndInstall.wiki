#summary Building and installing libwhefs

=Building and Installing=

==Unixish Platforms==

The build tree currently requires GNU Make 3.81 or higher. That said, see [WhefsAmalgamation] for details on how to create a single standalone source file which can be compiled using an arbitrary build tool.

To build the tree on Unixish platforms:

{{{
~> make
# Or, if you want to build using the TinyC compiler:
# ~> make CC=tcc CXX=tcc
}}}

Just for fun, try holding your breath while it builds. It'll only takes 2-3 seconds to build the library and supporting tools on a reasonably fast machine (and much faster with tcc - 0.85 seconds on my box using a non-parallel build).

*To install it:*

  * Copy `src/libwhefs.*` to a directory in your library search path.
  * Copy the directory `include/wh` to a directory in your INCLUDES search path.
  * Copy `app/whefs-*` to a directory in your executable search path.

Some day i'll add `make install` rules, but the makefile code is intentionally kept overly simple.

==Non-Unixish Platforms==

This code is 100% untested on non-Unix platforms. In theory, [WhefsAmalgamation the amalgamation build] should compile on any system which provides C99 support and two or three non-C99 (but POSIX-1.2001) functions used for dealing with file-based EFSes.

=Using whefs from client code=

To use libwhefs from client code:

  * Include the appropriate header file(s) from `<wh/whefs/*.h>` and/or `<wh/whio/*.h>`. If you're using the [WhefsAmalgamation amalgamation build] you'll need to include `whefs_amalgamation.h` _instead of_ the other headers.
  * Link against `-lwhefs`.
