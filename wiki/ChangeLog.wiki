----

*22 June 2009*
  * Added optional support for `mmap()`ing file-based storage, which can speed up access. In some simple benchmarks `mmap()`ing cut the number of disk seek operations by about 75%.

*21 June 2009*
  * Added the [WhefsCat whefs-cat] tool.

*20 June 2009*
  * Added `whefs_stream_open()` to provide sequential-only access to a pseudofile. This simplifies using pseudofiles together with `whio_stream_gzip()`, `whio_stream_copy()`, etc.
  * Fixed Issue #6, where closing an EFS while there are open pseudofiles would leak a file/device handle. They are now closed automatically during `whefs_fs_finalize()` if the client fails to close them beforehand.

*19 June 2009*
  * Added public `whefs_fs_entry` type and `whefs_fs_entry_foreach()` to iterate over all in-use EFS entries.
  *  First packaged release.
