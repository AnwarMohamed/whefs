whoi_epfs (hereafter called EPFS) is a component of the whio i/o library on top of which whefs is built. It is currently (December, 2009) being developed to replace most of the internals of whefs. 

EPFS is basically whefs stripped of inode names support. EPFS is currently functional, but the refactoring of whefs will be a large undertaking (a complete rewrite), and i do not expect to get around to it until possibly Q2 2010.

It is described in more detail in the whio source repo:
